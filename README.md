# Image matting
    This is an experiment of image matting, it's based on <Deep Image Matting>. But I don't get the performance as the paper mentioned. I think there are two reasons: 1. The author only provides a part of data. 2. There are some parameters I don't get optimal.

    This rep provide different baselines in this question, include U-net, PSPNet, ASPPNet, etc.. 
    you just run this command: python train.py -c config.json to train the model, you can choose model in different config
